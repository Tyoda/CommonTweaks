# CommonTweaks

This mod will, in the future, add an assortment of stuff to the game.

This is a server mod.

This mod requires both <a href="https://github.com/ago1024/WurmServerModLauncher">ago's server modlauncher</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Tyoda/CommonLibrary">CommonLibrary</a> mod installed to work.

# Features
## Sound timer module.

 - Fix sounds not playing when the player is completing the action too quickly. This way a certain sound will play every 5 seconds, regardless of how many actions were completed in that time.
 - Inspired by <a href="https://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/190633-playing-sound-on-action-timer-tick/">this post.</a>
